This repository contains an initial set of React circuit drawing and network mapping components which are used within the ESnet Portal, but are not tied to ESnet, or even to network visualization.

The mapping portion of this library is used in the public facing [ESnet Portal](http://my.es.net). The circuit diagrams code us used internally to track ESnet circuits in the ESDB.

Current features of the library include:

 * Circuit diagrams:
     - Basic
     - Concatenated
     - Parallel
 * Circuit couplers
 * Patch panel diagrams
 * Topology mapping
     - Higher level network traffic visualization
     - Linear, arc, bidirectional traffic and square edge types
 * Route rendering

Please browse the examples for a feel for the library, or read the getting started guide to jump right in.
